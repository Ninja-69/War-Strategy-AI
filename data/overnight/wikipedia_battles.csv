"{'name': 'Lou Diamond', 'summary': 'Leland ""Lou"" Diamond (May 30, 1890 – September 20, 1951) was a notable member of the United States Marine Corps. He fought in France during World War I, served in China during the interwar period, and fought in the Guadalcanal campaign as a master gunnery sergeant during World War II in the 1st Marine Division, before retiring in 1945.\nDiamond was born in Bedford, Ohio, and enlisted in the Marine Corps in 1917. He saw action in World War I with the 6th Marine Regiment, participating in various battles. After the war, he briefly returned to civilian life but re-enlisted in 1921. He served in China and helped design a new infantry pack during the interwar period. In World War II, Diamond was an expert in mortars and made significant contributions to battles on Guadalcanal, receiving a commendation from General Alexander Vandegrift. He was evacuated due to physical disabilities and later became an instructor in the U.S. He retired in 1945 and died in 1951.

"{'name': 'Military career of Adolf Hitler', 'summary': 'The military career of Adolf Hitler, who was the dictator of Germany from 1933 until 1945, can be divided into two distinct portions of his life. Mainly, the period during World War I when Hitler served as a Gefreiter (lance corporal) in the Bavarian Army, and the era of World War II when he served as the Supreme Commander-in-Chief of the Wehrmacht (German Armed Forces) through his position as Führer of Nazi Germany.', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_career_of_Adolf_Hitler', 'source': 'Wikipedia'}"
"{'name': 'Napoleonic tactics', 'summary': 'Napoleonic tactics are certain battlefield principles used by national armies from the late 18th century until the invention and adoption of the rifled musket in the mid 19th century. Napoleonic tactics are characterised by intense drilling of soldiers; speedy battlefield movement; combined arms assaults between infantry, cavalry, and artillery; relatively small numbers of cannon; short-range musket fire; and bayonet charges. French Emperor Napoleon I is considered by military historians to have been a master of this particular form of warfare. Military powers would continue to employ such tactics even as technological advancements during the industrial revolutions gradually rendered them impractically obsolete, leading to devastating losses of life in the American Civil War, the Franco-Prussian War, and World War I.', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleonic_tactics', 'source': 'Wikipedia'}"
"{'name': 'First French Empire', 'summary': 'The French Empire (French: Empire français; Latin: Imperium Francicum), known retroactively as the First French Empire, was the empire ruled by Napoleon Bonaparte, who established French hegemony over much of continental Europe at the beginning of the 19th century. It lasted from 18 May 1804 to 6 April 1814 and again briefly from 20 March 1815 to 7 July 1815, when Napoleon was exiled to Saint Helena.\nHistorians refer to Napoleon\'s regime as the ""First Empire"" to distinguish it from the restorationist Second Empire (1852–1870) ruled by his nephew Napoleon III. Neither should be confused with the French colonial empire, which refers to France\'s various colonies, protectorates and mandate territories all throughout its history, regardless of political system (including, by some definitions, some or all of France\'s current overseas territories).\nOn 18 May 1804 (28 Floréal year XII on the French Republican calendar), Napoleon was granted the title Emperor of the French (Empereur des Françai', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_French_Empire', 'source': 'Wikipedia'}"
"{'name': 'Napoleonic era', 'summary': ""The Napoleonic era is a period in the history of France and Europe. It is generally classified as including the fourth and final stage of the French Revolution, the first being the National Assembly, the second being the Legislative Assembly, and the third being the French Directory. The Napoleonic era begins roughly with Napoleon Bonaparte's coup d'état on 18 Brumaire, overthrowing the Directory (9 November 1799), establishing the French Consulate, and ends during the Hundred Days and his defeat at the Battle of Waterloo (18 June 1815).\nThe Congress of Vienna soon set out to restore Europe to pre-French Revolution days. Napoleon brought political stability to a land torn by revolution and war. He made peace with the Catholic Church (Concordat of 1801) and reversed the most radical religious policies of the National Convention. In 1804, Napoleon promulgated the Civil Code, a revised body of civil law, which also helped stabilize French society. The Civil Code affirmed the political and"", 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleonic_era', 'source': 'Wikipedia'}"
"{'name': 'Battle of annihilation', 'summary': 'Annihilation is a military strategy in which an attacking army seeks to entirely destroy the military capacity of the opposing army.  This strategy can be executed in a single planned pivotal battle, called a ""battle of annihilation"". A successful battle of annihilation is accomplished through the use of tactical surprise, application of overwhelming force at a key point, or other tactics performed immediately before or during the battle.\nThe end goal of a battle of annihilation is to cause the leaders of the opposing army to sue for peace due to the complete annihilation of their army and thus inability to further engage in offensive or defensive military action. It is not necessary to kill or capture all, or even most, of an opposing army\'s forces to annihilate it in the sense used here. Rather, the destruction of the enemy army as a cohesive military force able to offer further meaningful military offense or defense, even if temporarily, is the objective.', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_annihilation', 'source': 'Wikipedia'}"
"{'name': 'Battle of Austerlitz', 'summary': ""The Battle of Austerlitz (2 December 1805/11 Frimaire An XIV FRC), also known as the Battle of the Three Emperors, was one of the most important military engagements of the Napoleonic Wars. The battle occurred near the town of Austerlitz in the Austrian Empire (now Slavkov u Brna in the Czech Republic). Around 158,000 troops were involved, of which around 24,000 were killed or wounded.\nThe battle is often cited by military historians as one of Napoleon's tactical masterpieces, in the same league as other historic engagements like Hannibal's Cannae (216 BC) or Alexander the Great's Gaugamela (331 BC). The military victory of Napoleon's Grande Armée at Austerlitz brought the War of the Third Coalition to an end, with the Peace of Pressburg signed by the French and Austrians later in the month. These achievements did not establish a lasting peace on the continent. Austerlitz had driven neither Russia nor Britain, whose armies protected Sicily from a French invasion, to settle.

"{'name': 'Napoleonic Code', 'summary': ""The Napoleonic Code (French: Code Napoléon), officially the Civil Code of the French (French: Code civil des Français; simply referred to as Code civil), is the French civil code established during the French Consulate in 1804 and still in force in France, although heavily and frequently amended since its inception. Although Napoleon himself was not directly involved in the drafting of the Code, as it was drafted by a commission of four eminent jurists, he chaired many of the commission's plenary sessions, and his support was crucial to its enactment.\nThe code, with its stress on clearly written and accessible law, was a major milestone in the abolition of the previous patchwork of feudal laws. Historian Robert Holtman regards it as one of the few documents that have influenced the whole world.\nThe Napoleonic Code was not the first legal code to be established in a European country with a civil-law legal system; it was preceded by the Codex Maximilianeus bavaricus civilis (Bavaria, 175"", 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleonic_Code', 'source': 'Wikipedia'}"
"{'name': 'Military career of Napoleon', 'summary': 'The military career of Napoleon spanned over 20 years. He led French armies in the French Revolutionary Wars and later, as emperor, in the Napoleonic Wars. Despite his comprehensive battle-winning record, Napoleon ended his career in defeat. Nevertheless, European history has since been regarding Napoleon as a military genius and one of the finest commanders in history. His battles, campaigns and wars have been studied at military schools worldwide. Such campaigns as the Italian campaign of 1796–1797, the Ulm campaign and the Six Days\' Campaign demonstrated his strategic and tactical genius. He fought more than 80 battles, losing only ten, mostly towards the end when the French army was not as dominant. As historian Alexander Mikhailovsky-Danilevsky put it, Napoleon was a ""despotic sovereign of the battlefield, in whose presence but few generals ventured to maneuver,\nstriving only to ward off his blows.""
